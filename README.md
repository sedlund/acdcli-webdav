# sedlund/acdcli-webdav

Alpine Linux base with [acd_cli](https://github.com/yadayada/acd_cli) and fuse installed and lighttpd serving webdav over SSL

## usage opportunities

**NOTE**: This image must be started with `--privileged` to use the Docker hosts /dev/fuse

More will be added here, but interim look at the docker-compose.yml in the git repo for how to run this.  This image is still coming together so layout and things are sure to change.

Scripts and config files based from jgeusebroek/webdav
